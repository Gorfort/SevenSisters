                <h1>Red Gate Administrative Building</h1>
                <h3>Высотное здание на площади Красных Ворот</h3>
                <p>The 138-metre building consists of a central 24-storey building and two side buildings with a
                    variable
                    number of storeys ranging from 11 to 15. The exterior walls of the skyscraper are clad in natural
                    limestone, while the ground floors are clad in red granite. The interiors of the building are more
                    modest than in other Stalinist skyscrapers. For example, stainless steel was used in the front lobby
                    and
                    there are no expensive materials or picturesque panels.
                    The central building on the courtyard side had an assembly hall (on the ground floor) and an
                    exhibition
                    hall (on the basement). A tunnel was created along the perimeter of the basement with an entrance
                    from
                    the side of Komsomolskaya Square. It was intended for trucks serving the services of the building.
                    The
                    building was originally built for the needs of the Ministry of Railways. However, by 1951, when the
                    works were completed, a new union agency Mintransstroi existed and it got the offices in the central
                    block of the skyscraper.
                    All flats had refrigerators, built-in-furniture and sinks with a crusher to destroy large waste in
                    the
                    kitchens. The kitchens also had access to a rubbish chute. In addition to the traditional
                    ventilation
                    system, the house had central air conditioning. For this purpose, outdoor air was filtered and
                    passed
                    through a humidification system before reaching a temperature of +15°C. Then, depending on the
                    season,
                    the air was heated to the right temperature. All high-rise buildings were equipped with a
                    centralised
                    dust extraction system, which consisted of a system of brushes and hoses located in each flat, a
                    system
                    of pipes running along with the building and dust extraction stations installed in the basement. The
                    collected dust was filtered and discharged into the sewage system, and the purified air from the
                    system
                    was discharged into the street. Boilers were installed in the basement to provide heating for the
                    skyscraper.</p>

                <h1>Kudrinskaya Square Building</h1>
                <h3>Жилой дом на Кудринской площади</h3>
                <p>The building was richly decorated but lacked a unified stylistic direction. The parapets are in the
                    ancient Roman style. The lobbies decorated with marble columns, stained-glass windows, and lamps in
                    the
                    form of candelabra are a reminiscence of Gothic interiors. The pointed turrets around the spire
                    resemble
                    the domes of an Orthodox church.[3] On the roof of the stylobate, there are sculptural portraits of
                    Soviet workers and soldiers.
                    One of the stylistic features of the building were the stained glass windows, which are located in
                    the
                    halls above the lifts and the windows of the deli. Motifs from Russian folk culture were used in the
                    design. The floors in the living rooms and corridors of the flats were laid with oak parquet, the
                    bathrooms were tiled with metal tiles, and the kitchens with linoleum.
                    All the flats had refrigerators and built-in furniture in the kitchens.[3] In addition to the
                    ventilation system, the building had centralised air conditioning. The building was equipped with a
                    centralized dust extraction system, which consisted of brushes and hoses located in each flat,
                    piping
                    running along with the building, and vacuuming stations installed in the basement.[3] The collected
                    dust
                    was filtered and discharged into the sewage system, and the purified air was discharged into the
                    street.
                    Boilers were installed in the basement to provide heating for the whole building.The skyscraper was
                    laid
                    down in 1950 and completed in 1954.[4] It was the last of the Seven Sisters to be completed.
                    Its apartments were originally intended for cultural leaders of the former USSR; they are currently
                    inhabited by wealthy Russians.</p>

                <h1>Leningradskaya Hotel</h1>
                <h3>Хилтон Москоу Ленинградская</h3>
                <p>In the 1930s, a new architectural style began to take shape in the Soviet Union, later called the
                    "Stalinist". One of the characteristic features directly dictated by the Soviet government were
                    borrowings from the culture of previous epochs. This position of the authorities was not a
                    recommendation, but a must: "serious shortcomings in the mastering [by architects] of the cultural
                    heritage of the past show little attention to the national heritage, to the Russian architectural
                    classics, to national and folk art". This attitude led to the appearance of the Leningradskaya Hotel
                    project, which was implemented.[4]
                    The influence of medieval Russian architecture was more evident in the exterior design of the
                    building
                    than in other Stalinist skyscrapers. Contemporaries noted that the white-red-gold colouring of the
                    walls
                    "recalls the favourite colours of ancient Russian architecture", the central section is
                    stylistically
                    close to the Kremlin towers. The main entrance is designed in the form of a terem porch. It is
                    decorated
                    with multi-cornered cornices, fanciful pediments, hanging weights and pinnacles.[5] The ribs and
                    emblem
                    of the octagonal spire, the rosettes between the pylons and the orbs on the obelisks are covered in
                    gold.[6]
                    The stylistic borrowings in the interiors of the hotel are even more significant. Elements of
                    decoration
                    were copied from samples of pre-Petrine palaces and churches. The lift hall, decorated with golden
                    smalt
                    and Shoksha porphyry, is made in the form of an altar niche. The chandeliers in the halls and on the
                    staircases are stylised as paniculars.[7] Motifs from Russian history were used in the decoration of
                    the
                    interiors: on the ground floor, two round medallions are placed above the stairwells. One of them
                    symbolises the Russian victory at the Kulikovo Field, the other the victory at the Battle of the
                    Ice.

                <h1>Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building</h1>
                <h3>Котельническая набережная</h3>
                <p>Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building is one of seven Stalinist skyscrapers laid down in September 1947
                    and
                    completed in 1952, designed by Dmitry Chechulin (then Chief Architect of Moscow) and Andrei
                    Rostkovsky.
                    The main tower has 32 levels (including mechanical floors) and is 176 metres (577 ft) tall. At the
                    time
                    of construction it was the tallest building in Europe.[2]
                    The building also incorporates a 9-story apartment block facing Moskva River, designed by the same
                    architects in 1938 and completed in 1940. Initially built in stern early Stalinist style, with wet
                    stucco wall finishes, it was re-finished in terracotta panels in line with the central tower and
                    acquired ornate pseudo-Gothic crowns over its 12-story raised corners and center tower. By the end
                    of
                    World War II, the side wing was converted to multi-family kommunalka housing, in contrast to the
                    planned
                    elite status of the central tower.
                    The central tower, of a conventional steel frame structural type, has a hexagonal cross-section with
                    three side wings (18 stories, including two mechanical floors). While it is not exceptionally tall
                    or
                    massive, the "upward surge" of five stepped-up layers, from a flat 9-story side wing to the spire,
                    gives
                    the impression of a more massive structure. The structure hides behind itself a so-called "Shvivaya
                    Gorka," a hill with historical architecture and a maze of steeply inclined streets. Chechulin was
                    initially criticized for complete disregard of this area, but his bureaucratic influence brushed off
                    any
                    criticisms.</p>

                <h1>Hotel Ukraina</h1>
                <h3>Гостиница Украина</h3>
                <p>LHotel Ukraina was commissioned by Joseph Stalin.[6] It was designed by Arkady Mordvinov and
                    Vyacheslav
                    Oltarzhevsky (the leading Soviet expert on steel-framed highrise construction), and is the second
                    tallest of the neoclassical Stalin-era "seven sisters" (198 m (650 ft), with 34 stories). It was the
                    tallest hotel in the world from the time of its construction until the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel
                    opened in Atlanta, Georgia, United States in 1976. Construction on the low river bank meant that the
                    builders had to dig well below the water level. This was enabled by an ingenious water retention
                    system,
                    using a perimeter of needle pumps driven deep into the ground.Domestic architects began to actively
                    discuss the possibility of building high-rise buildings in Moscow after the 1917 revolution. Very
                    shortly thereafter, there were many interesting projects; for example, the skyscraper project of the
                    Supreme Economic Council building on the Lubyanka Square, designed by Vladimir Krinsky in 1923.[7]
                    In
                    the same year, the Vesnin brothers proposed a project for the Palace of Labor, whose high-rise
                    building
                    was a tower 132 meters high.[8]
                    The government supported the desires of architects to rebuild the capital of the Soviet Union. In
                    1940,
                    architect Dmitry Chechulin published a draft of a 24-story public building on the Dorogomilovsky
                    Bend of
                    the Moscow River - the hotel "Ukraine" subsequently appeared at this place. The sketches were
                    published
                    in Issues 11–14 of the magazine Construction of Moscow. All the preparatory work on this project
                    progressed very slowly, and with the start of World War II, work was completely frozen.[9]</p>

                <p>A 15-hectare plot was allocated for the construction of an administrative building in Zaryadye. It
                    was
                    bounded by Red Square to the west, Kitaygorodsky Proyezd to the east and Moskvoretskaya Embankment
                    to
                    the south.
                    The authors of the project had the difficult task of blending the 32-storey high-rise building into
                    the
                    historic buildings of the centre of Moscow. The administrative building in Zaryadye, along with
                    other
                    high-rise buildings, was to serve as a symbol of the greatness of socialist Moscow and the Stalinist
                    era.[2]
                    The structure was symmetrical and had a stepped structure. Similar to the Building of the USSR
                    Ministry
                    of Foreign Affairs, the administrative high-rise started with five-storey buildings in with the
                    surrounding low-rise buildings. The buildings were located diagonally concerning one another and
                    were
                    equipped with lifts. In the lower part of the building, there were to be about 2,000 workrooms and
                    offices for the staff of the department.[1]
                    The upper part of the building was separated from the lower part by two intermediate levels. The
                    first
                    of them was to be three storeys high, and the next, a six-storey one, served as a kind of transition
                    to
                    the high-rise tower. This construction, topped with a gilded polyhedral tent with a spire and an
                    emblem
                    with symbols of the USSR, was the main part of the building. The upper floors of the tower were used
                    as
                    a showroom with four pavilions. The radial system of the administrative building contributed to the
                    convenient organisation of the internal premises, the even distribution of wind loads and the
                    strength
                    of the structural links, which increased the building's stability.[2]</p>

                <h1>Palace of the Soviets</h1>
                <h3>Дворец Советов</h3>
                <p>The Palace of the Soviets was a project to construct a
                    political convention center in Moscow on the site of the demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.
                    The
                    main function of the palace was to house sessions of the Supreme Soviet in its 130-metre (430 ft)
                    wide
                    and 100-metre (330 ft) tall grand hall seating over 20,000 people. If built, the 416-metre (1,365
                    ft)
                    tall palace would have become the world's tallest structure, with an internal volume surpassing the
                    combined volumes of the six tallest American skyscrapers.[10]
                    Boris Iofan won a series of four architectural competitions held in 1931–1933 marking the beginning
                    of a
                    sharp turn of Soviet architecture from 1920s modernism to the monumental historicism of Stalinist
                    architecture. The individuals behind these events and their motives remain a matter of conjecture
                    and
                    debate. Recent research supports the hypothesis that Iofan had been the chosen architect from the
                    very
                    start and manipulated the competitions to his own benefit.
                    The definitive design by Iofan, Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Helfreich was conceived in 1933–1934
                    and
                    took its final shape in 1937. The staggered stack of ribbed cylinders crowned with a 100-metre (330
                    ft)
                    statue of Vladimir Lenin blended Art Deco and neoclassical influences with contemporary American
                    skyscraper technology. Work on the site commenced in 1933; the foundation was completed in January
                    1939.
                    The German invasion in June 1941 ended the project. Engineers and workers were diverted to defense
                    projects or pressed in the army; the installed structural steel was disassembled in 1942 for
                    fortifications and bridges.
                    After World War II, Joseph Stalin lost interest in the palace. Iofan produced several revised,
                    scaled-down designs but failed to reanimate the project. The alternative Palace of the Soviets in
                    Sparrow Hills, which was proposed after Stalin's death, did not proceed beyond the architectural
                    competition stage.</p>
